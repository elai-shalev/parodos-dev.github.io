# Creating Extracted OpenAPI Documents for Integrating Systems on Serverless Workflows
The blog post will guide developers on how to extract openAPI documents to a new file of manageable size. The need for this procedure has risen in account of restrictions that Quarkus imposes with accepting large YAML files as input [(see appendix)](#appendix). This restriction directs us to be mindful and plan ahead which resources services we would need in our workflow.

Please note that there is a way to work around the input file size restriction, as will be demonstrated in the [(appendix.)](#appendix)


In this guide, we will explain what is an OpenAPI Document, how to read and use the openAPI Specification, and eventually we will cover the steps to extract an openAPI document in a valid manner. 

## What is an OpenAPI Document?
>A self-contained or composite resource which defines or describes an API or elements of an API. 

OpenAPI documents are a standardized way to view a system’s exposed paths, resources and webhooks, and act as an alternative to using restAPI calls for interacting with other systems.
An OpenAPI document uses and conforms to the OpenAPI Specification, and in itself is a JSON object (which may be represented either in JSON or YAML format). 

For the OpenAPI Spec Documentation, see: https://swagger.io/specification/

## How to make sense of an OpenAPI Document:
Let’s take a look at this [openAPI document](../../assets/examples/github-openapi.yaml) for some reference. This is an extracted version of a [larger openAPI document](https://github.com/github/rest-api-description/blob/main/descriptions/api.github.com/api.github.com.yaml)

              # Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
              ## Our Pledge
              In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
              ## Our Standards
              Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
              * Using welcoming and inclusive language
              * Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
              * Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
              * Focusing on what is best for the community
              * Showing empathy towards other community members
              Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
              * The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
              * Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
              * Public or private harassment
              * Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
              * Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
              ## Our Responsibilities
              Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response
                                to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
              Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
              ## Scope
              This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address,
                                posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
              ## Enforcement
              Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [EMAIL]. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
              Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
              ## Attribution
              This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org), version 1.4, available at [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/).

The JSON object hierarchy can be described in the following diagram:  
```
openapi

The document begins by specifying the openAPI version, an info object, and specifying the servers.
```

 ```

The document will then display the system's paths, and must include at least one path.  
Under each path, the document specifies the path URI, an HTTP method, parameters (if needed), the requestBody, and defines the responses. 
Note that both the request and the responses can reference a component from a different part of the document. This will be important when we try to extract the document to our needed purposes. 

Moreover, it's good to notice now that references to components from some paths may trigger more refernces, as some components reference other components within themselves.  

An example for a path structure can be seen here:

</pre>
</div>

Lastly, The document specifies the components it uses in its paths. 
A component can be a schema for any resource, some parameter specification object, HTTP headers and more. To get a better understanding, [see some openAPI official examples.](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/tree/main/examples/v3.0)
As mentioned before, some components can also reference other components. Let's take a look in the 'workflow-run' component.

As we can see, the 'workflow-run' component is referencing other schemas in the document. This becomes important if you wish to extract an openAPI document to a smaller size, as you would need to track all recursive references and include all components that got mentioned in the way. 

Note the securitySchemas object, which specifies the authentication method used: 
```
securitySchemes:
   BearerToken:
     type: http
     scheme: bearer
```

## How to extract an OpenAPI Document to workable size?
### Manual and logical approach
Let's say we have an outline of a serverless workflow, and a very large openAPI document that exposes many system resources, much more than we intend on using.

The procedure for extracting the openAPI document can be logically described as the following:

1. Copy any ‘openapi’, ‘info’, ‘security’, ‘servers’ objects to the new document.    
2. Identify all system resources that are needed for the workflow.
3. For each resource, locate the path object  that returns the needed resource. 
4. For each path, create a dependency tree of all components referenced by the path, and of all components referenced by those components, recursively. 
4. Include the securitySchema of the original ‘components’ object. 
5. Include any webhooks the application may need.  

This procedure can be quite tedious when done manually, so some efforts were made to automate the process. 

### Python script to extract documents

The [following script](https://github.com/parodos-dev/serverless-workflows/blob/main/hack/filter-openapi-specs.py) can be used to extract reuced openAPI documents from larger ones. 
The script takes an input file, and output file, and a list of tuples (path objects, http method). 
```
python extract.py openapi_spec.json filtered_openapi_spec.json \
"/apis/apps/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/deployments post" \
"/apis/apps/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/deployments/{name} get" \
"/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/services post" \
"/apis/route.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/routes post" \
"/apis/route.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/routes/{name} get" \
"/apis/route.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/routes/{name}/status get"
```
For each path, it extracts all dependencies (refs) that come with it in a recursive way. 
* Note that currently some references may be missed by the script. 
* The script accepts a JSON file type as input.  

Some upcoming efforts will look into integrating this logic natively in the kn-workflow CLI. 


## Best Practices and Warnings:
**Document size:** Even though the Quarkus engine has a YAML input file size limit of 3MB, the `kn-workflow` CLI generates k8s resources (configmaps) for spec/schema files.  
K8s has a default size limit of ~1MB per resource, and by default they get applied to all as part of the helm charts created. 
Therefore, it is best practice to keep the extracted openAPI documents to under 1MB, until this practice is changed.

### Appendix:

#### Input file size restriction errors:

Quarkus uses [snakeYAML](https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml/src/master/) to process the input YAML files in a serverless workflow. A default setting of a maximum size limit has been put in place, which inhibits accepting large files. 
```
Caused by: org.yaml.snakeyaml.error.YAMLException: The incoming YAML document exceeds the limit: 3145728 code points.
[...]
[ERROR] Error parsing content
com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.yaml.JacksonYAMLParseException: The incoming YAML document exceeds the limit: 3145728 code points.
 at [Source: (StringReader); line: 82506, column: 15]
 ```

 For reference, a [reproducer](https://github.com/ElaiShalevRH/reproducers) was creater for this issue.  

<a name="appendixB"></a>

#### Size restriction workaround:
By passing the following parameter to the Java build environment, it is possible to set the maximum YAML input file size limit. 
```
-DmaxYamlCodePoints=99999999
```
The CodePoints parameter refers to Unicode points, which are essentially the number of characters in the input file (for UTF-8 encoding)
The maximum code point number is the integer max, 2^31-1.
