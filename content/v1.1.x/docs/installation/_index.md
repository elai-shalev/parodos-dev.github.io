The deployment of the orchestrator involves multiple independent components, each with its unique installation process. Presently, our supported method is through a specialized Helm chart designed for deploying the orchestrator on either OpenShift or Kubernetes environments. This installation process is modular, allowing optional installation of components if they are already present.

The Orchestrator deployment encompasses the installation of the engine for serving serverless workflows and Backstage, integrated with orchestrator plugins for workflow invocation, monitoring, and control.

In addition to the Orchestrator deployment, we offer several *workflows* (linked below) that can be deployed using their respective installation methods.
