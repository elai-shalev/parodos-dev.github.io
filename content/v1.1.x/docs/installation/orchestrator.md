Installing the Orchestrator is facilitated through a Helm chart that is responsible for installing all of the Orchestrator components.
The Orchestrator is based on the [SonataFlow](https://sonataflow.org/serverlessworkflow/latest/index.html) and the [Serverless Workflow](https://serverlessworkflow.io/) technologies to design and manage the workflows.
The Orchestrator plugins are deployed on [Red Hat Developer Hub
](https://developers.redhat.com/rhdh/overview) instance, serves as the frontend.
To utilize *Backstage* capabilities, the Orchestrator imports software templates designed to ease the development of new workflows and offers an opinionated method for managing their lifecycle by including CI/CD resources as part of the template.
